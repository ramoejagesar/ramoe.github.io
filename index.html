	<h1>Hello World, Welcome to LegalStat!</h1>
		<p>LegalStat project I started with during 10 Days of Code. <a href="/blog">Read more about Days of Code ...</a> In a nutshell, LegalStat is about analysing case law ('jurisprudence') from the court of Rotterdam. By combining key information and circumstances mentioned in the case I hope to predict the courtâ€™s outcome or success rates of future cases.</p>
